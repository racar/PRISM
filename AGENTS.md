## Injected PRISM Context
### minimumcd-pipeline-architecture — MinimumCD Pipeline Reference Architecture
**Type:** skill | **Tags:** cicd, pipeline, devops, quality-gates, deployment, continuous-delivery | **Uses:** 0
Fail fast, fail cheap: order quality gates so the cheapest and most common failure detectors run first. Six sequential stages with strict time budgets enforce this. When designing or implementing a fu
→ `/home/rafael-carrascal/.prism/memory/skills/minimumcd-pipeline-architecture.md`

### react-component-patterns — React Component Patterns
**Type:** skill | **Tags:** react, frontend, components, typescript, hooks | **Uses:** 0
Prefer composition over inheritance. Keep components small (< 100 lines), extract custom hooks for logic, and colocate state as close to its usage as possible. When creating React components, especial

### git-conventional-commits — Git Conventional Commits
**Type:** pattern | **Tags:** git, commits, conventions, versioning | **Uses:** 0
Conventional Commits give structured commit history that tools (semantic-release, changelogs, PRISM memory) can parse automatically. The type prefix communicates intent at a glance. Every time you wri

### cicd-github-actions-basic — GitHub Actions CI/CD Basics
**Type:** skill | **Tags:** cicd, github-actions, devops, automation | **Uses:** 0
Use `on: [push, pull_request]` for CI. Cache dependencies with `actions/cache` to cut build times by 60–80%. Separate CI (test on PR) from CD (deploy on merge to main). When setting up automated tests

### error-handling-patterns — Error Handling Patterns
**Type:** pattern | **Tags:** error-handling, backend, api, reliability, python, nodejs | **Uses:** 0
Fail fast at boundaries (user input, external APIs), be explicit about error types, and never swallow exceptions silently. Log context with errors, not just the message. When writing code that calls e

### docker-compose-dev — Docker Compose for Local Development
**Type:** skill | **Tags:** docker, docker-compose, devops, local-dev, containers | **Uses:** 0
Use named volumes for databases (survives `docker compose down`), anonymous volumes for `node_modules` inside containers, and bind mounts for source code (enables hot reload). When setting up a local

### nodejs-testing-jest — Node.js Testing with Jest
**Type:** skill | **Tags:** nodejs, testing, jest, javascript, typescript | **Uses:** 0
Use `describe`/`it` blocks for structure, `beforeEach` for setup, and `jest.mock()` for isolating dependencies. Prefer `mockResolvedValue` over `mockReturnValue` for async code. When writing unit or i

### python-fastapi-structure — Python FastAPI Project Structure
**Type:** skill | **Tags:** python, fastapi, api, backend, structure | **Uses:** 0
Separate routers by domain, use dependency injection for shared resources (db session, auth), and let Pydantic schemas handle all validation at the boundary. When starting or structuring a FastAPI pro

## File Access Permissions

### ✅ Automatic Read Permission

You have automatic permission to read files in this project WITHOUT asking for explicit confirmation. Simply use the file reading tools (Read, Glob, Grep) directly when you need to understand the codebase.

**Automatically Allowed Files:**
- Source code (*.py, *.js, *.ts, *.tsx, *.jsx, etc.)
- Configuration files (*.json, *.yaml, *.yml, *.toml, .env.example)
- Documentation (*.md, *.txt)
- Style files (*.css, *.scss)
- HTML files
- PRISM config (.prism/**/*)
- Test files (tests/**/*, specs/**/*)

**Protected Files (Require Explicit Permission):**
- Secrets (.env*, *.key, *.pem, credentials/**/*)
- Private keys (.ssh/**/*)
- Large directories (node_modules/**, .git/**, dist/**, build/**)
- Binary files and build outputs

**Usage:**
```
Read("src/main.py")
Glob("src/**/*.ts")
Grep("function", path="src/")
```

### ✅ Automatic Write Permission (Create & Edit)

You have automatic permission to create and edit files in this project WITHOUT asking for explicit confirmation. Simply use the file writing tools (Write, Edit) directly when you need to implement changes.

**Automatically Allowed:**
- Create new source code files
- Edit existing source code files
- Update configuration files
- Modify documentation files
- Create and update test files
- Write to PRISM configuration files

**Protected (Require Explicit Permission):**
- Environment files (.env*, *.key, *.pem)
- Secrets and credentials directories
- SSH keys and AWS credentials
- Large dependency directories
- Binary files

**Usage:**
```
Write("src/new_file.py", content="...")
Edit("src/existing_file.py", oldString="...", newString="...")
Edit("path/to/file.py", oldString="...", newString="...", replaceAll=True)
```

**Guidelines for Writing:**
- Create files in appropriate locations following project structure
- Use existing code patterns and conventions
- Add final newlines to all new files
- Keep methods under 10 lines when possible
- Follow the project's domain vocabulary for naming
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones unless necessary
- Use `replaceAll=True` only when intentionally changing all occurrences

Proceed with confidence when reading and writing files to understand and work with the codebase.
