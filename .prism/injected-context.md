## Injected PRISM Context
### minimumcd-pipeline-architecture — MinimumCD Pipeline Reference Architecture
**Type:** skill | **Tags:** cicd, pipeline, devops, quality-gates, deployment, continuous-delivery | **Uses:** 0
Fail fast, fail cheap: order quality gates so the cheapest and most common failure detectors run first. Six sequential stages with strict time budgets enforce this. When designing or implementing a fu

### react-component-patterns — React Component Patterns
**Type:** skill | **Tags:** react, frontend, components, typescript, hooks | **Uses:** 0
Prefer composition over inheritance. Keep components small (< 100 lines), extract custom hooks for logic, and colocate state as close to its usage as possible. When creating React components, especial
→ `/home/rafael-carrascal/.prism/memory/skills/react-component-patterns.md`

### git-conventional-commits — Git Conventional Commits
**Type:** pattern | **Tags:** git, commits, conventions, versioning | **Uses:** 0
Conventional Commits give structured commit history that tools (semantic-release, changelogs, PRISM memory) can parse automatically. The type prefix communicates intent at a glance. Every time you wri

### cicd-github-actions-basic — GitHub Actions CI/CD Basics
**Type:** skill | **Tags:** cicd, github-actions, devops, automation | **Uses:** 0
Use `on: [push, pull_request]` for CI. Cache dependencies with `actions/cache` to cut build times by 60–80%. Separate CI (test on PR) from CD (deploy on merge to main). When setting up automated tests

### error-handling-patterns — Error Handling Patterns
**Type:** pattern | **Tags:** error-handling, backend, api, reliability, python, nodejs | **Uses:** 0
Fail fast at boundaries (user input, external APIs), be explicit about error types, and never swallow exceptions silently. Log context with errors, not just the message. When writing code that calls e

### docker-compose-dev — Docker Compose for Local Development
**Type:** skill | **Tags:** docker, docker-compose, devops, local-dev, containers | **Uses:** 0
Use named volumes for databases (survives `docker compose down`), anonymous volumes for `node_modules` inside containers, and bind mounts for source code (enables hot reload). When setting up a local

### nodejs-testing-jest — Node.js Testing with Jest
**Type:** skill | **Tags:** nodejs, testing, jest, javascript, typescript | **Uses:** 0
Use `describe`/`it` blocks for structure, `beforeEach` for setup, and `jest.mock()` for isolating dependencies. Prefer `mockResolvedValue` over `mockReturnValue` for async code. When writing unit or i

### python-fastapi-structure — Python FastAPI Project Structure
**Type:** skill | **Tags:** python, fastapi, api, backend, structure | **Uses:** 0
Separate routers by domain, use dependency injection for shared resources (db session, auth), and let Pydantic schemas handle all validation at the boundary. When starting or structuring a FastAPI pro
