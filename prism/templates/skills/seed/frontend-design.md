# Frontend Design

## Key Insight

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Trigger

When building any frontend component, page, application, or interface where visual quality and memorable design matter.

## Design Thinking Process

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **BOLD** aesthetic direction:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
2. **Tone**: Pick an extreme aesthetic direction:
   - Brutally minimal
   - Maximalist chaos
   - Retro-futuristic
   - Organic/natural
   - Luxury/refined
   - Playful/toy-like
   - Editorial/magazine
   - Brutalist/raw
   - Art deco/geometric
   - Soft/pastel
   - Industrial/utilitarian
3. **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
4. **Differentiation**: What makes this **UNFORGETTABLE**? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality, not intensity.

## Implementation Requirements

Implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:

- ✅ Production-grade and functional
- ✅ Visually striking and memorable
- ✅ Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- ✅ Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography
- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
- Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter
- Opt for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes

### Motion
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Use Motion library for React when available
- Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals
- Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry
- Overlap
- Diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors:
- Gradient meshes
- Noise textures
- Geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies
- Dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders
- Custom cursors
- Grain overlays

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)

❌ Generic AI-generated aesthetics  
❌ Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)  
❌ Clichéd color schemes (purple gradients on white backgrounds)  
❌ Predictable layouts and component patterns  
❌ Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character  
❌ Converging on common choices (Space Grotesk, etc.) across generations  

## Creative Mandate

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between:
- Light and dark themes
- Different fonts
- Different aesthetics

**NEVER** converge on common choices across generations.

## Complexity Matching

Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision:
- **Maximalist designs**: Need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
- **Minimalist designs**: Need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details
- **Elegance comes from executing the vision well**

## Remember

Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back—show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

## Usage Example

```
User: "Create a landing page for a coffee subscription service"

Design Direction: Warm, organic, editorial/magazine aesthetic with 
rich brown tones, cream backgrounds, elegant serif typography 
(like Playfair Display), and subtle grain textures.

NOT: Generic purple gradients, Inter font, and cookie-cutter cards.
```
